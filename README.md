## Hi there 👋

My name is **Rocco Polimeni** and I am working as a **SDE Intern @ Amazon Web Services (AWS)** within the Commerce Platform. I have been working with this team for two summers and have been primarily working on **Fullstack, Serverless Webapps** where I use AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) to implement Infrastructure as Code, Typescript + React for the frontend, and Java + Dagger for backend lambda functions.

I have started an Accelerated Masters Program at Stevens, where I will be graduating with an M.S. in Machine Learning in May 2023.

**Skilled in ReactJs, NodeJs, MongoDb, GraphQL, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Firebase Authentication, RESTfull APIs, C++ Development, Java Development, Applied Machine Learning (python3), Dagger Dependency Injection.**
